# Data Analysis Project for a Pizzeria

## Introduction

In this project, I built a database for a fictional pizza place. The goal was to better understand and improve how the restaurant works, focusing on things like orders, what's in stock, and scheduling staff. I used SQL for detailed data work and connected everything to Google Cloud and Looker for clear, visual reports. This project is all about using data smartly to make the restaurant run better.
## Project Overview

- **Data Modeling**: Designed a relational database model using QuickDBD.
- **Data Manipulation**: Wrote SQL queries for in-depth analysis and exploration.
- **Data Visualization**: Took advantage of Google Cloud for ability to connect to Looker and made interactive visual dashboards.

## Data Modeling

I started by designing a data model using QuickDBD to clearly represent the relationships between different aspects of data.
